This stylesheet is designed to integrate WP-Members with the Twenty Ten theme.
There are quite a few examples in here of what you can do to style the forms.  
You can build off of this or start from scratch and set your own 
custom css for the plugin (set the location in the admin panel).

See http://rocketgeek.com/tips-and-tricks/setting-up-a-custom-wp-members-stylesheet/
for information on how to set up the plugin with a custom stylesheet.
